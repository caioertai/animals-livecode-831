- [x] Define an Animal (class) with an `initialize(name)` constructor, exposing its name (getter/reader).
- [x] Define three `Lion`, `Meerkat` and `Warthog` classes
- [x] Implement a `#talk` instance method which returns a sentence like "Simba roars" for each animal. (Hint: Meerkats bark and Warthog grunt)
- [x] In another Ruby file, create an array with Simba, Nala, Timon & Pumbaa, iterate over it and puts the sound each animal make
- [x] Implement `::phyla` which will return an array of the four phyla of the animal kingdom.
- [ ] Add an #eat(food) instance method in Animal which returns a sentence like “Timon eats a scorpion”. Then override this method for the Lion class, and return a sentence like “Simba eats a gazelle. Law of the Jungle!”
